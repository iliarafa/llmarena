Refine the Landing Page to be ultra-compact, borderless, and typographically rich.

1. The 'Auth' Section (Top):

Remove Borders: completely remove the white background/borders/shadows from the 'Try as Guest' and 'Sign In' containers.

Layout: Make this a clean 2-column grid (grid-cols-2 gap-8) centered on the page.

Typography:

Headers: text-sm font-bold uppercase tracking-wide text-gray-900.

Subtext: text-xs text-gray-500 mb-4.

Buttons: Keep the buttons full-width within their columns, but reduce their height slightly (py-2 text-sm) to feel more compact.

2. The Feature List (Bottom):

Layout: Keep the single column, but align it perfectly with the 2-column grid above (max-w-3xl mx-auto).

Density: Drastically reduce vertical padding (py-3 per item). This should feel like a tight list, not a loose collection.

Typography:

Titles: text-sm font-bold uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-900.

Descriptions: text-xs text-gray-500 font-normal.

Icons: Make them smaller (w-4 h-4) and aligned with the cap height of the title.

3. Rich Text Highlighting (The 'Medium Weight' Keywords):

Inside the descriptions, use a darker, medium-weight font (font-medium text-gray-700) for specific keywords to make them pop.

Update the content to exactly this HTML structure:

Compare Models: Run <span class="font-medium text-gray-900">GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, and Grok</span> side by side.

Pay As You Go: No subscriptions. Buy credits starting at <span class="font-medium text-gray-900">$2.50</span>. Credits <span class="font-medium text-gray-900">never expire</span>.

True Privacy: Zero logs. Data vanishes from <span class="font-medium text-gray-900">RAM instantly</span> when session ends.

Blind Mode: Unbiased evaluation. Identities scrambled using <span class="font-medium text-gray-900">Fisher-Yates shuffling</span>.

Caesar: AI Arbiter. Detection of factual divergences with <span class="font-medium text-gray-900">Hallucination Alerts</span>.

Maximus: The Champion. <span class="font-medium text-gray-900">Synthesizes</span> best insights into one <span class="font-medium text-gray-900">perfect response</span>.

Goal: A seamless flow where the Auth buttons and Feature List feel like one cohesive, high-density instrument panel.
